Gratisphp
PHP sample project

This project uses ddev.
https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/quickstart/

That said, if docker is not on a given machine it could run as native php project

Items to take into consideration.

The root index.php file lives under the public folder.

The database configuration lives on config.php.
